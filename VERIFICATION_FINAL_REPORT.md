- **Perfect Role Consistency**: Every transaction has exactly one target
- **No Target-Investor Conflicts**: No company is both target and investor in the same transaction

### 2. Statistics
- **Total Transactions**: 882
- **Total Companies**: 1,537
- **Average Companies per Transaction**: 2.77
- **Companies with Arcadia IDs**: 1,277 (83.1%)

## Issues Found and Resolution

### Issue 1: Phantom IG_ID 3055
**Status**: Minor Issue
**Details**: IG_ID 3055 appears in 5 company records but does not exist in transactions
**Companies affected**:
1. JPUniverse (target)
2. Mitsubishi UFJ Bank (participant)
3. Mizuho Innovation Frontier (participant)
4. Toppan Printing (participant)
5. Undisclosed (lead)

**Root Cause**: This was identified earlier as a duplicate IG_ID issue with Mitsubishi UFJ Bank
**Resolution**: This is a known data entry issue that was already documented. The transaction was likely removed or renumbered during data cleaning.
**Impact**: Minimal - affects only 5 companies out of 1,537 (0.3%)

### Issue 2: False Positive - Company Names with '&'
**Status**: Not an Issue
**Details**: 6 companies flagged as potential parsing artifacts
**Resolution**: Manual review confirms these are legitimate company names:
- Aream & Co.
- BANANACULTURE GAMING & MEDIA
- Draper & Associates
- Engine Gaming & Media
- German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs & Energy
- Whitwell & Co

1. **Remove phantom IG_ID 3055** from the 5 affected company records
2. **Continue mapping** the 260 companies without Arcadia IDs

### Future Process Improvements
1. Add validation to prevent phantom IG_IDs during data entry
2. Implement automated checks before finalizing company extractions
3. Create a reconciliation process for removed/renumbered transactions

## Conclusion

The data verification confirms that the IG_ID connections between the two files are **robust and reliable**. The linkage system is working as designed with only one minor phantom reference affecting 0.3% of records.

### Final Verdict: **PRODUCTION READY**

The data structure is sound, the connections are properly maintained, and the identified issues are minor and well-documented. The system is ready for production use with the noted minor cleanup recommended but not required for functionality.
