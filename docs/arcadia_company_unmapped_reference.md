## Data Consolidation Process

This file was created through:
1. **Investor String Parsing**: Complex "Investors / Buyers" strings parsed into individual entities
2. **Deduplication**: Exact name matching to consolidate duplicate entries
3. **Smart Merging**: 97.5% similarity threshold (though all merges were exact matches)
4. **IG_ID Concatenation**: All transaction IDs preserved with ", " separator
5. **Role Preservation**: Roles maintained in order corresponding to IG_IDs
6. **Status Transformation**: "TO BE ENRICHED" â†’ "TO BE CREATED", roles lowercased

## Usage Guidelines

### For Arcadia Import
1. All records with empty `id` field will receive new Arcadia IDs upon import
2. "Undisclosed" retains existing ID=366
3. Status field indicates import readiness
4. All fields are Arcadia-compliant

### IG_ID and Role Correspondence
- The `IG_ID` field contains comma-separated transaction IDs
- The `ig_role` field contains corresponding roles in the same order
- Example: IG_ID "100, 200, 300" with ig_role "target, lead, participant" means:
  - Transaction 100: company was target
  - Transaction 200: company was lead investor
  - Transaction 300: company was participant investor

### Data Integrity
- No company appears as both target and investor in the SAME transaction
- All dual-role companies participate in DIFFERENT transactions
- Data has been validated for import compatibility
