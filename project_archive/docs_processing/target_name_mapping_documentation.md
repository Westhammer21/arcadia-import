## Data Quality Improvements

### Sector Mapping Fix (2025-09-04 21:40)

**Issue Identified:**
- 46 records with Sector='Platform&Tech' were incorrectly mapped to arc_sector='Other'
- The arc_segment was correctly set to 'Platform & Tech' but arc_sector was wrong

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed arc_sector from 'Other' to 'Platform & Tech' for all 46 Platform&Tech records
- Verified consistency with existing format (spaces and ampersand)

**Verification:**
- ✅ All 46 Platform&Tech records now correctly mapped to 'Platform & Tech'
- ✅ Gaming records correctly mapped to 'Gaming (Content & Development Publishing)'
- ✅ Esports records correctly mapped to 'Esports'
- ✅ Other records correctly mapped to 'Other'
- ✅ 100% sector mapping consistency achieved

### Country Mapping Fixes (2025-09-04 16:42)

**Country Mapping Fixes Applied:**
- **Issue**: 97 records had 2-letter ISO codes instead of full names
- **Issue**: 14 records had 'notenoughinformation' despite valid Target's Country
- **Solution**: Converted all ISO codes to full country names
- **Result**: 111 out of 115 records now have proper country names
- **Remaining**: 4 records with 'notenoughinformation' (empty Target's Country)

### Verification Completed:
- ✅ All 2-letter codes converted (US→United States, GB→United Kingdom, etc.)
- ✅ No changes made to non-'TO BE CREATED' records
- ✅ No other columns modified during country fix
- ✅ Data integrity fully preserved


---

## Validation Checks

✅ All required fields populated
✅ All 2-letter ISO codes converted to full country names
✅ URLs validated and standardized
✅ Ticker patterns detected for ownership
✅ Duplicate targets handled with data enrichment
✅ 96.5% of records have proper country mapping (111/115)
