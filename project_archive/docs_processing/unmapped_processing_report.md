## Processing Results

### Input
- **Source**: 883 unmapped transactions from `ig_arc_mapping_full_vF.csv`
- **Characteristics**: Transactions present in InvestGame but not in Arcadia

### Processing Steps Applied

#### 1. Corporate Transaction Mapping (80 records)
Applied context-aware rules based on transaction size and company age:

| Rule | Mapped To | Category | Count |
|------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Size ≤ $5M | seed | Early-stage investment | 3 |
| Size > $10M | undisclosed late-stage | Late-stage investment | 5 |
| No size, Age ≤ 3 years | undisclosed early-stage | Early-stage investment | 2 |
| No size, Age > 3 years | undisclosed late-stage | Late-stage investment | 64 |
| No size, No age | undisclosed late-stage | Late-stage investment | 6 |

#### 2. Type Mapping Updates (59 records)
| Original Type | New Mapping | Count |
|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Series A+ | undisclosed early-stage | 16 |
| Series B+ | undisclosed late-stage | 43 |

#### 3. Category Standardization (All 883 records)
Changed "Investments" to "investment" (singular, lowercase) to match Arcadia format

#### 4. Comprehensive Encoding Fix (All text fields)
Applied complete UTF-8 to ASCII conversion while preserving apostrophes:

**Phase 1 - Initial Fix (Target Names & Investors):**
| Fix Type | Description | Records Affected |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Apostrophes Preserved | Kept apostrophes (') in company/investor names | 54 |
| Special Characters Fixed | Converted ö→o, ü→u, ç→c, ß→ss, etc. | 218 |
| Target Names | Fixed encoding issues | 50 |
| Investors/Buyers | Fixed encoding issues | 42 |

**Phase 2 - Short Deal Description Deep Scan:**
| Character Found | Unicode | Occurrences | Fix Applied |
|-----------------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| ' | U+2019 | 290 | → ' (apostrophe) |
| " | U+201D | 61 | → " (quote) |
| " | U+201C | 59 | → " (quote) |
| ­ | U+00AD | 13 | → (removed - soft hyphen) |
| ' | U+2018 | 5 | → ' (apostrophe) |

**Total Encoding Fixes:**
- Short Deal Description: 227 values fixed (428 issues resolved)
- Target Names: 4 values fixed with apostrophes restored
- Investors/Buyers: 0 remaining issues
- **Final Status**: 100% ASCII-compliant (apostrophes preserved)

**Examples of Preserved Names:**
- We're Five Games ✓
- That's No Moon Entertainment ✓
- Don't Nod Entertainment ✓
- Gulliver's Games ✓

#### 5. Target Name Enrichment (763 records matched) 
Enriched transactions with Arcadia company data through target name matching:

**Initial Matching Results:**
| Enrichment Type | Description | Results |
|-----------------|-------------|---------|
| Successful Matches | Target names matched to Arcadia companies | 728 (82.4%) |
| No Matches | Target names not found in Arcadia | 155 (17.6%) |
| Multiple Company Issues | Different companies with same name | 0 (0.0%) |
| Company Columns Added | New arc_ prefixed columns | 22 columns |

**Re-matching After Encoding Fixes (2025-09-03):**
| Metric | Value | Improvement |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| New Matches Found | 35 | +4.0% |
| Final Matched | 763 (86.4%) | ↑ from 82.4% |
| Remaining Unmatched | 120 (13.6%) | ↓ from 17.6% |
| Match Types | Exact: 11, Fuzzy: 24 | High confidence |

**Notable New Matches:**
- Double Loop Games → Double Loop (ID: 774)
- GameStop (NYSE: GME) → GameStop (ID: 389)
- That's No Moon Entertainment → Thats No Moon Entertainment (ID: 1652)
- Square Enix Montreal → Square Enix Montreal (ID: 3852)
- Z League → Z League (ID: 3408)

**Matching Approach:**
- Case-insensitive smart matching with normalization
- Checked against 3 fields: name, also_known_as, aliases
- Handled comma-separated aliases
- Special handling for Team 17 (mapped to ID 163)

**Key Enrichment Columns Added:**
- arc_id, arc_status, arc_name, arc_type
- arc_founded, arc_hq_country, arc_hq_region
- arc_ownership, arc_sector, arc_segment
- Plus 12 additional company metadata columns

#### 6. Investor Placeholder Standardization (427 records)
Standardized placeholder values in the 'Investors / Buyers' column:

| Pattern Type | Description | Count | Percentage |
|--------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| Empty/Null | Empty strings, null values | 423 | 47.9% |
| Dash Pattern | One or more dashes (-, --, etc.) | 0 | 0.0% |
| Short String | Strings ≤2 characters | 2 | 0.2% |
| Undisclosed Variations | 'undisclosed', 'n/a', etc. | 2 | 0.2% |
| **Total Converted** | All placeholders → 'Undisclosed' | **427** | **48.4%** |
| Valid Investors | Preserved actual investor names | 456 | 51.6% |

**Detection Rules Applied:**
1. Empty/Null: Empty strings, null values, or missing data
2. Dash Pattern: One or more dashes only (-, --, ---, etc.)
3. Short String: Strings with ≤2 characters after trimming
4. Undisclosed Variations: Case-insensitive matches for 'undisclosed', 'n/a', 'none', 'unknown', 'tbd', 'tba'

**Unique Patterns Converted:**
| Original Value | Pattern Type | Occurrences |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| 'nan' (empty) | Empty/Null | 423 |
| 'Undisclosed' | Undisclosed Variation | 2 |
| 'TT' | Short String | 1 |
| 'HP' | Short String | 1 |

**Data Quality Impact:**
- Before: Inconsistent placeholder representations (4 unique patterns)
- After: Standardized 'Undisclosed' for all unknown investors
- Result: Clean distinction between known (456) and unknown (427) investors
- Benefit: Improved data consistency for analysis and reporting
